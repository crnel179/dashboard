## comments:

Tailwind is an amazing CSS framework which allows you to "rapidly build modern websites without leaving your HTML", or in this case, JSX. Instead of having separate CSS files, one is able to use utility-classes such as: flex, pt-4(padding-top: 4), text-center and so on, to style the app components easier and faster.
